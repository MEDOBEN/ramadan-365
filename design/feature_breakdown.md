# Feature Breakdown - Ramadan 365

## 1️⃣ Daily Small Worship (Core)
- **Content Types**:
  - **Dhikr**: "SubhanAllah" (33x) with a simple haptic counter.
  - **Du'a**: Short, powerful prayers from the Sunnah.
  - **Ayah**: One verse with a very brief reflection (1 sentence).
  - **Good Deed**: "Make a prayer for a stranger today."
- **Audio**: High-quality, calm recordings for pronunciation and immersion.

## 2️⃣ Monthly Faith Challenges
- **Themed Progression**:
  - Muharram: Reflection
  - Safar: Patience
  - Rabi' al-awwal: Love for the Prophet (PBUH)
  - ... and so on.
- **Micro-Tasks**: Tasks that take < 2 minutes.

## 3️⃣ Voluntary Fasting Reminders
- **Logic**: Automatically calculates Hijri dates for White Days (13, 14, 15).
- **Reminders**:
  - Evening before (to prepare for Suhoor).
  - Morning of (encouragement).
- **Tone**: "Sunnah Fasting tomorrow? 🌙 A beautiful way to revive the spirit."

## 4️⃣ Ultra-Light Content
- **Micro-Reflections**: Instead of articles, we provide 140-character "Spiritual Nuggets".
- **Offline Library**: The first 365 days of content are pre-loaded to ensure it works in any environment (travel, low data).

## 5️⃣ Faith Streak (The Glow)
- **Visual Representation**: A "Spirit Lamp" or "Glowing Heart" on the main screen.
- **Consistency vs. Perfection**:
  - 1-3 days: Soft glow.
  - 4-10 days: Radiant light.
  - 11+ days: Pulsing, warm aura.
- **Missed Day**: The light shifts from warm gold to a soft, cool blue—never dark.

## 6️⃣ Smart Personalization (AI)
- **Time-Aware**: Suggests "Morning Adhkar" in the AM and "Gratitude/Reflection" in the PM.
- **Activity-Based**: If the user typically opens the app at 10 PM, the reminder shifts to 9:45 PM.
- **Privacy**: All AI calculations happen **on-device**. No user data is sent to any server.
