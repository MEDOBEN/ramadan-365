## 📖 Full Description:
**Experience the Light of Ramadan, 365 Days a Year.** 🌙

Do you miss the spiritual clarity and peace that comes with Ramadan? We often start the year with big goals, only to feel overwhelmed and discouraged. **Ramadan 365** is designed for the busy Muslim who wants to stay connected to Allah through small, consistent, and beautiful acts—without the pressure or guilt.

**Why Ramadan 365?**
🌿 **Micro-Worship**: One daily action that takes less than 30 seconds. A short Du'a, a simple Dhikr, or a beautiful Ayah.
🤍 **Consistency over Perfection**: Our "Faith Glow" tracks your progress without resetting your streak. If you miss a day, your light just dims—it never goes out.
📅 **Monthly Challenges**: Light themes like "Patience" or "Gratitude" with 3-5 simple tasks to help you grow.
🌙 **Fasting Reminders**: Gentle notifications for Sunnah fasting days (Mondays, Thursdays, and White Days).
📴 **Offline-First**: No internet? No problem. All content is available whenever and wherever you are.
✨ **Minimalist UX**: A calm, clutter-free experience designed to be the most peaceful minute of your day.

**No Ads. No Pressure. No Noise.**
Just a simple path to a more spiritual you, one small step at a time.

**"The most beloved of deeds to Allah are those that are most consistent, even if they are small."** (Prophet Muhammad ﷺ)

Start your journey today. Let the light grow. 🤍
