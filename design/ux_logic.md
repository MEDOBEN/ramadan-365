# Screen Flow & UX Logic - Ramadan 365

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "The Quiet App"
The app should not feel like another "to-do" list. It should feel like a digital tasbih or a calm morning breeze.

- **Colors**: Sage green, soft cream, muted gold, and deep twilight blue.
- **Typography**: Clean, rounded sans-serif (e.g., Quicksand or Montserrat) for a friendly feel.
- **Interactions**: Haptic feedback on completion, slow transitions.

## 📱 Screen Flow

### 1. The Main Screen (The Hearth)
The only screen most users will ever need.
- **Top**: Current date + Month theme (e.g., "Month of Patience").
- **Center**: The **Daily Action Card**.
  - Large, readable text.
  - "Tap to complete" button (a soft glowing circle).
  - Optional "Listen" icon for audio.
- **Bottom**: The **Streak Glow**. 
  - Not a number, but a soft aura that grows brighter and warmer as consistency increases.
  - Simple navigation icons: [Home, Challenges, Settings].

### 2. Monthly Challenges
- A simple grid or list of 3-5 light goals for the month.
- Example: "Smile at 3 people this week" or "Read 1 page of Qur'an today".
- No "X" or "Fail" icons. Just a checkmark if done.

### 3. Settings & Reminders
- Simple toggles for:
  - Daily Action Reminder (Time picker).
  - Fasting Reminders (Mondays/Thursdays/White Days).
  - Silent Mode (No sound, just vibration).

## 🧠 UX Logic: "Faith Streak Without Pressure"
- **The "No-Reset" Rule**: If a user misses a day, the light doesn't extinguish; it just dims slightly. 
- **Recovery Logic**: Completing the next day brings the brightness back.
- **Completion Flow**:
  1. User reads/listens.
  2. User taps "Completed".
  3. A short, beautiful animation (e.g., a flower blooming or a light pulsing).
  4. An encouraging message appears: *"May it be accepted from you 🤍"*
  5. The card transforms into a "Done" state for the rest of the day.

## 🔔 Notification Logic
- **Tone**: "A gentle whisper".
- **Example**: *"A small moment for your soul is waiting... 🌿"*
- **Frequency**: Never more than twice a day (Daily action + Fasting reminder if applicable).
